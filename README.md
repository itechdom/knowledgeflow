## the perfect fit

## Current Problem

* Searching and browsing clothing items on the internet is very challenging. it's a time consuming experience. Both from the browsing point of view and the negative side effects of it, meaning returning clothes. 
* it impacts retailers where returning clothes is very expensive.
* the negative side effect impacts the retailer (Amazon, Urban Outfitters, ... etc)
	* Because the user can't find their right fit
* Virtual Fitting rooms attempted to solve this problem
	* but there are too many variables to simulate in a virtual environment.
	* different clothing items look very different on certain body types or certain measurments (hip, bust,waist)

## Our solution

* Our solution is very simple, but we think is effective
* We just take certain information from each consumer like their body type and other measurements.
* We crowdsource our data
	* each consumer reviews a clothing item, shares them
	* we group them into one product and allow any customer to shop and view that clothing items, see it on all body types
	* hence solving the problem of browsing for a product which both have a side effect on the user and the busienss
	* this is our bootstrapping step
* other data sources
	* Image recognition to categorize user's clothing pictures by body type
	* Import accuracy clothing data from external sources
