# Begin

Waves are everywhere and Math is no exception. Let's explore waves together.
Use keys WASD or arrow keys to move the circle around.

- Use any arrow key to dismiss this dialog

# Knot

Oops! There is a problem! go to at mile x50 there is a shape in need! Go over there and investigate.

- Arrow: Point in the direction of x = 50

You have reached the injured triangle. Carry it to x100
The circle will carry a rectangle to mile 100.
Once the circle is in mile 100 point, transition to the end.

# End

you have reached the end

You were moving in a sinusoidal way. [wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave)
Well, that's all! Thanks for trying out this demo.

Can we pose this problem as a equation

- boundery [0 , 100] (create walls)
- x === 50
- x === 100
- objects[2].x === 100
